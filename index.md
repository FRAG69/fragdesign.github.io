# Who am I?

I'm a 30 something developer who graduated with a BA(hons)Design for Games degree in 2012, since then I've been expanding my skills into areas outside of game development as the tools we use evolve with the times. 
I'm currently working on [Postal 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/707030/POSTAL_4_No_Regerts/) as a level designer with the awesome folks at [Running With Scissors](https://runningwithscissors.com/) 
In my spare time I still work on [Operation: Black Mesa](https://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa) as a level designer using the **CSGO** branch of the [Source engine](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) with [Tripmine Studios](https://tripminestudios.com/community/)

During the day I work as a part time Technical Demonstrator at [Plymouth College of Art](https://www.plymouthart.ac.uk) where I run workshops covering Unreal Engine 4 & Virtual Reality creative practices for the BA Game Arts course there.
